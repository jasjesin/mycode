Trevor's been in InfoSec earlier n now in Infrastructure
  lot of infoSec work is infra, like how do u secure infra,
    huge amt of overlap b/w infoSec n infra
  knows s/w engg. like scyla, python, goLang
  done Engineering & Devops earlier
  Data Science is his next focus

small company, will get to do a lot more things than just k8s

Infra SRE
  We do administration of k8s,
  we also build infra using tf,
  we also do SRE work
  we also do DB Architecture
  we doing all sorts of stuff
  we do application load balancers
  we do communications for TLS
  DevOps, all within our scope
  its all over the map, we'll take broader range

  one of the things Trevor wants for this role is
    get into things & own it, figure out how to do it & get it done
    he wants ppl who have that drive
    u see a problem, u go & solve it
    dont care if its somebody else's scope
    they dont care either
    we all try to work as a team to get something done, so lets do it
    i hate wen ppl r protective on scope

  AWS Security
    key mgmt
    secrets mgmt
    how u login to EC2 instances
    how u login to DBs
    how u do access ctrl
    n/w security
    its all AWS security for most part
    keys mgmt, secrets mgmt
    These r big gaps tht need a lot of focus
    most companies hv issues wid infra security

  If i work under Trevor,
    he'll try to drive me to understand policy
    how it applies in infoSec
    how to accomplish things from infra perspective to meet policy best practices

    lot of infra drive, here, is towards move to best practice
    getting those foundations & improving foundational security

    wen Trevor joined Sentilink,
      all infra was in a single AWS a/c
      he worked on to split diff. environments wid diff. a/cs.

      SpaceLift -- CI/CD in tf

  Driving towards IaaC, good practices towards deploying infra
  a lot of stuff goes into security.
  We need change ctrl
  ephemeral infra, dont want svrs tht r long-lived,
    dont want ppl to make changes to svcs by hand
    thats a foundational security concern.

  if i want good alerting on my svr,
    i wanna know wen somebody logged on n made a change
  thrs lot of noise n tons of changes like OS-related changes etc
  all that false alert noise needs to reduce so that
  if somebody does make a change, wen somebody breaks into svr,
    we need to know abt it right away.

  no clicking in AWS console,
  need an alert each time somebody makes a change or creates a resource or
    a deployment happens outside of spaceLift, tf

  all infra should b built using s/w development, all IaaC

  GITOps enables security n makes it much easier
  GITOps is lil bit WIP

  been doing lot of migrations earlier. SpaceLift is 1st deploy
  all tf modules r in spaceLift
  thr r 2 apps tht r lil bit difficult to transition in

  start alerting wen ppl make changes or thru console
  nobody should be using roles to create infra anymore

  u shouldnt login as admin to console, ppl need break-glass thing for exceptions

  nobody uses admin access

  if anybody logs in as admin, raise an alert
  thts the kind of stuff which will catch a hacker

  start seeing somebody doing weird, u investigate

  meeting best practice really enables u to meet high quality security

  its all abt high quality n hygiene

  we use AWS, postGres, k8s
  we rely heavily on AWS managed svcs, cuz its much less work

  serverless EKS wid fargate, is next plan, once AWS starts supporting calico

  kms, secrets mgr

  infra sre n devops
    sre -- doing development work so that u can improve operations
      developing monitoring n alerting,
      wen u see an issue come up n u didnt catch it in time or wasnt escalated properly
        thats the kind of work SRE would develop so that next time if it happens,
          it happens much more smooth, gets escalated properly, handled n fixed.
      it is s/w development but it is process development as well

      DevOps is more like build n deploy of s/w...CI/CD is development of infra
      DevSecOps is securing, making sure not putting in infra that is insecure
      infra is like anything that exists on AWS

      we not doing any huge amt of development work on k8s continously cuz it works right now
      it works for engineering team, without any problem

      we do hv alerts, need to move worker nodes on spot instances to save some money
      its in our scope

      DBs -- DB development work n administration work, difficult ones to identify who owns the scope
        its b/w 3 teams, schema development team, same ppl doing s/w engineering, platform backend engineering
          guys who write python, goLang code, they r developing schemas, creating tables, SQLs for backend s/w
        data engineering team specializes in massaging n creating data for us.
        ultimately we r a data company

        we create DB infra wid tf

        we want more ppl getting more hands on wid DBs, as its a lil bit of weak spot

      20-30 ppl in engineering team
        tf interview -- deploy same infra to a/c, will hv few bugs, need to fix those to get it working
          troubleshooting exercise on AWS n tf
            VPC, EC2 instance, n/wing like SGs, deep dive on these n u should be good.

        4-panel is tech interview but nothing crazy
