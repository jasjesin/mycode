# Functions inside class are called methods
# Methods starting & ending wid __ are called magic methods
#      cuz Python invokes these methods internally for execution,
#      based on situations, and we do not need to call these methods
# self is standard convention in python
# __init__(self) is constructor method, that instantiates/assigns values
#           internally, when an instance of class is created
# __str__(self) method returns string representation of object(instance of class)
# __repr__(self) method helps provide debug sttmts to Python Debugger
#             goal is to be unambiguous & help recreate original object easily
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, grades):
        self.name = name  # takes whtever self is & accesses name property inside of it

jas = Person("Jas", (83, 76, 92, 71, 64))  # Python calls init method automatically
print(jas)  # gives object description like
#                      <__main__.Person object at 0x10c859f50>

jas = Student("Jas", (82, 87, 93, 74, 61))  # use class to create object of it
#                                             This new thing behaves like class
# Basically python creates new empty container & runs init method,
# and creates empty thing called self, sets/changes property name under self
# python gives that loaded self and name given to that self, now, as, jas
print(jas)  # This time, see difference in object description given by python like
#                      Name: Jas, Grades: (83, 76, 92, 71, 64)
#             So, this time, __str__ is invoked internally by Python

# instance, class & static methods
# instance methods r used most of the time, to produce action from data passed
#                  inside the object
# class methods r used often as factories, good to restrict specific value
#      as one of pre-defined ones. These invoke class to create new object.
# static method is used for code organization

# Type Hinting -- we can mandate types expected and IDE can pass hints

# __name__ is a global var in Python tht changes based on which file

# How does python knows from which path, module needs to be imported from

#               print(sys.path), provides list of paths for python to look for
#               print(sys.modules) provides list of imported modules
# absolute imports preferable, relative is confusing

# decorators -- allow us to easily modify fns

    def secure_admin(*args, **kwargs): # takes any no. of args

@make_admin_secure      # << this is how we use decorators

    return "admin1234"

# below one not needed anymore wid decorator used before fn definition
# get_admin_passwd = make_admin_secure(get_admin_passwd)
print(get_admin_passwd())

# @ syntax for decorators
# decorating fns wid pmtrs
# use *args, **kwargs as pmtrs in decorator fn for it to accept any args
# adding pmtrs to decorators themselves
# mutability in python
# immutable objects -- tuples, strings, integers, floats & booleans
