code for tf, ansible and k8s can co-exist together in same branch in git repo
This helps gain version control, security through Merge Requests, Traceability
and we can setup pipelines to trigger infra deployment as well as application deployment on valid commit
This is gitops!

2 strategies:
1. Push - with each change, pipeline gets triggered to update changes in infra
2. Pull - ArgoCD -- an agent is setup at GitRepo to look for changes, n deploy changes to infra
          ArgoCD makes sure that state defined in git repo is same as state in infrastructure
          Ex: if someone makes manual changes in infa, ArgoCD will detect change in state and will revert it to align wid git repo

gitops makes sure tht git is single src of truth for infrastructure
