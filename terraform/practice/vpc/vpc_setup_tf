Step 1: Setup VPC, IG, RT, EIP (optional, can be created in next step with NAT gw)
    vpc.tf
    ig.tf
    rt.tf
    eip.tf

IAM Access added/needed >>
          AmazonVPCFullAccess

Step 2: Create Public ONLY 1st wid its respective RT & associate RTs
    subnet.tf -- update NOT to refer pvt subnet
    subnet_rt_public.tf
    Update data.tf NOT to invoke subnet details as those are yet to be created.
    associate_rt.tf  -- update to NOT refer to pvt subnet

Step 3: Create Pvt Subnet now, wid its respective RT & associate RTs &
        NAT gw that connects to public subnet & NACL that secure public subnet
    subnet.tf -- update to refer pvt subnet
    subnet_rt_pvt.tf
    associate_rt.tf -- update to refer pvt subnet
    Update data.tf to invoke public subnet details.
    nat_gw.tf
    nacl.tf

Step 4: Create SG n then EC2 as EC2 refers to SG
    sg.tf
    ec2.tf

IAM Access added/needed >>
          AmazonEC2FullAccess

Step 5: IAM user, group creation & their association. Then, policy creation & associate it to group
    user.tf
    group.tf
    associate_iam.tf
    policy.tf
    associate_iam_policy.tf

IAM Access added/needed >>
          IAMFullAccess

            terraform destroy --target=aws_instance.jas # shutdown ec2 once done wid work

Step 6: Setup Tgt Group, LB & Listeners
    tg.tf
    sg.tf -- add SG for ELB to refer to
    elb.tf
    elb_listener.tf
    associate_tg.tf


Step 7: Setup Launch Configuration & ASG
    sg.tf -- add SG for ASG
    tg.tf -- add TG for ASG
    asg_lc.tf
    asg.tf

IAM Access added/needed >>
          AutoScalingFullAccess

Step 8: Setup RDS Subnet, Pmtr Grp & RDS Instance
    sg.tf -- add SG for RDS
    subnet_rds.tf
    rds_pmtrs.tf
    rds.tf

IAM Access added/needed >>
        AmazonRDSFullAccess
        AWSKeyManagementServicePowerUser
        SecretsManagerReadWrite




ec2 instance keeps getting recreated wid each reconcilation, without any change to it
  use vpc_security_group_ids instead of security_groups to fix it.

Improvisation Work to do:
1. Dependencies on each step, need to be specified as explicit dependencies by using depends_on
2. Modularize the code
3. Start break-fixing the code by searching for issues on google
